# Multi--class-classification-CNN-
Multi- class classification of breast cancer abnormalities using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for multiclassification on a dataset of images.
Achieved an accuracy of 94% on the validation set after optimizing the model architecture and hyperparameters.
Used data augmentation techniques to increase the dataset size and improve model performance.
Proficient in deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras, as well as the programming language 
Python.
